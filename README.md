## Project 4: Data Professionals Survey in Power BI

In this project we use a raw data from a [Original Data Professionals Survey]( https://github.com/Lfraguela/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Data%20Professionals1.xlsx) and cleaned it to obtain the [Final Data Professionals Survey](https://github.com/Lfraguela/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Data%20Professionals.xlsx). The cleaned data was imported into Power BI Desktop to create a [Dashboard]( https://github.com/Lfraguela/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Power%20BI%20Project_Data%20Professionals%20Survey.pbix).

## Project 5: Bike buyers analysis with Excel

In this Excel project, we cleaned the [Bike buyers' data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heeraldedhia/bike-buyers?select=bike_buyers.csv), created pivot tables, charts, and a dashboard.
